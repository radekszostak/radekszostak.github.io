        <h1>Regreession using CNNs</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>In this project convolutional neural networks were employed to unconventional task of regression of continuous numeric value from image data.</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Terrain elevation maps generated using drone photogrammetry often reveal distortions in the water surface impeding the accurate samplig of water level from these maps. This study investigates the capability of convolutional neural networks to accommodate the aforementioned perturbations and effectively estimate water level from photogrammetric rasters.</p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>The task of proposed machine learning models is to estimate single value of water level given aerial image and elevation map of river and adjacend land as an input.</p>
        
        <p>Two regression approaches utilizing CNNs were explored: direct regression employing an encoder and solution based on prediction of the attention mask by an encoder-decoder architecture, subsequently used to sample values from the photogrammetric elevation map.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>Using CNN encoder for regression has performed significanty worse than mask sampling solution. This indicates that CNN encoders that are built for image pattern recognition not perform well in task of regression/sampling from input image. However, making appropriate custom modifications that take into account knowledge of the nature of the ML model and data allows for excellent results.</p>
